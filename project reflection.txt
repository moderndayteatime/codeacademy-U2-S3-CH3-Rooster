Reflection
Project was helpful in identifying areas I misunderstood, specifically, the thrown error. We learnt this a while ago in Section 2 but
I was confused how it tied into section 3. Also the automated tests are meant to throw an error and pass if the test does cause an error
instead of testing if it does not throw an error.
